Missing useful keymap combination:
- cmd+shift+tab to open closed tab
- cmd+shift+t to open global finder in intellij
- cmd+shift+o to open global file finder in IntelliJ
- shift to select stuff
- opt+right is tough to pull out but I use quite a bit to move between words
- Missing CAPSLOCK can be useful some times
